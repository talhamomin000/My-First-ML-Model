## Real Estate Price Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the price of real estate units based on various factors such as distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores nearby, latitude, and longitude. The prediction is made using a linear regression model trained on historical real estate data. Finally, build the web application using Dash library to predict the price of house based on ceertain input fields.


## Model

The prediction model used in this project is a simple linear regression model. It is trained on the provided real estate dataset to predict the price of a unit area based on features such as distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores, latitude, and longitude.

## Dataset

The dataset (`real_estate_data.csv`) used for training the model contains historical real estate data. It includes information about the distance to the nearest MRT station, the number of convenience stores nearby, latitude, longitude, and the price of a unit area.
